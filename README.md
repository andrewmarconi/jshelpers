Front-End (JavaScript) Helpers

This repository holds some simple little chunks of Javascript code (and whatever else I find useful). These are pieces that I come back to again and again, and have placed them here in the hopes that they will be useful to other people.

If you have any suggestions to make anything you find here better, feel free to fork the repository or get in touch using one of the methods below:
